Small and tight IIOP/GIOP engine written in C++.

Some software archaeology here. This doesn't compile or build yet - I'm storing it until I can allocate a bit of time to get my C coding back up to snuff.

This is old, old code - written around 1995-1997 by a guy in company I used to work for. It's of zero value at this point in time, and it was well constructed so a shame to let it disappear into the grave with the company that owned it.
